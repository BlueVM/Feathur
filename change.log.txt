==============================
0.6.3.8 - March 14, 2014

Notes: This really should be a couple of versions 
but I got caught up in trying to finish IPv6 before
changing the version numbers. IPv6 isn't done yet,
it should be next patch... I'll likely skip up to
0.6.4.0 as that's roughly where the code should be
after the IPv6 addition.
